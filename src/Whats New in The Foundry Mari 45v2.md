## Mari 4.5v2 Features
 
Mari 4.5v2 offers a range of features that make it easier and faster for artists to create stunning 3D textures and look development. Some of the key features are:
 
### 3D Projection Painting
 
Mari's projection-based painting system allows artists to paint on what feels like a virtual piece of glass and preview paint in context with the whole asset. Artists can make edits to paint before committing it, preview it in context and make 2D adjustmentsâfreeing artists from the limits of resolution and complexity.
 
Mari supports UDIM workflows, which means artists can work with hundreds of high-resolution texture maps per model. Mari also supports industry-standard formats like FBX, OBJ, Alembic and OpenEXR, making it easy to integrate with other DCC applications.
 
### Procedural Workflows
 
Mari's non-destructive layer and node graph systems make it easy for artists to create the look they want, offering an extensive range of procedurals. The Materials System gives artists the ability to easily create less complex, higher-volume assets or quickly lay down the building blocks for their hero assets.
 
Mari also offers a variety of vendor shaders, such as 3Delight, VRay, Unreal and Arnold, which allow artists to reduce round-tripping between Mari and other applications and ensure that their textures look correct in the final render.
 
### Production Pipeline Ready
 
Mari is designed to fit seamlessly into any production pipeline, with support for open standards like OpenColorIO and OpenSubdiv, as well as extensive Python API and scripting capabilities. Technical artists can easily automate workflows and handle color transforms with Mari's powerful tools.
 
### Quality that Scales
 
Mari can handle even the most complex assets, with the ability to scale to over one million polygons for a single topology without slowing down. Mari also supports up to 32K @ 32bit per UDIM, ensuring that artists can create high-quality textures without compromising on detail or performance.
 
## Conclusion
 
The Foundry Mari 4.5v2 is a powerful and versatile 3D painting software that offers a range of features and enhancements that make it an essential tool for any 3D artist. Whether you are working on games, films, TV shows or commercials, Mari can help you create stunning textures and look development with ease and efficiency.
