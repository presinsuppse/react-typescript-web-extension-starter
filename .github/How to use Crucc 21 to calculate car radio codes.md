Crucc 2.1 is the simple and fastest way to calculate car audio anti-theft security code via audio serial numbers[^1^]. It supports remote updates (RU) and has a compact radio database, to make easy identification of calculation algorithms by unit type[^2^]. It also includes the EUROVOX algorithm, which was added to this new version of Crucc 2.1[^2^].
 
To use Crucc 2.1, you need a USB dongle protection, which you can order from the official website[^2^]. Once you have the dongle, you can install the software on your computer and run it. You will see a window like this:

Then, you need to select the manufacturer and model of your car radio from the drop-down menus. You also need to enter the serial number of your device, which you can find on the label or on the screen. If you have a master code or a hardware jumper, you can enter them as well. Then, click on "Calculate" and wait for the software to generate the code for your device.
 
Once you have the code, you can enter it on your car radio using the buttons or the keypad. If the code is correct, your device will be unlocked and ready to use. If the code is wrong, you may have to try again or contact the manufacturer for assistance.
 
Crucc 2.1 is a useful tool for car audio professionals and enthusiasts who want to unlock their devices without paying fees or waiting for service. However, it is not a universal solution and it may not work for some models or brands. You should always check the compatibility of your device before using Crucc 2.1 and follow the instructions carefully.
  
## How to enter the code on your car radio
 
Once you have the code for your car radio, you need to enter it on your device to unlock it. The exact method may vary depending on the manufacturer and model of your radio, but here are some common steps:
 
- Turn on your radio and wait for the message that asks for the code.
- Use the preset buttons or the keypad to enter the code. For example, if your code is 1234, press the first button once, the second button twice, the third button three times, and the fourth button four times.
- Press and hold the enter button or another button that confirms the code. You may hear a beep or see a message that indicates that the code is accepted.
- Enjoy your music!

If you enter the wrong code, you may have to wait for a few minutes before you can try again. If you enter the wrong code too many times, you may lock your radio permanently and need to contact a dealer for help.
